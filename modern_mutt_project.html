            <h2> Overview </h2>
            <p> Modern Mutt is an IOS and Android Native App that offers customers pet products that are stylish and functional. Modern Mutt caters to the needs of pet owners who want to decorate their homes while also ensuring their pets are
              comfortable, without sacrificing one for the other.
            </p>
            <p>I was the UX/UI designer for this project. I developed the initial concept, user stories and flows, wireframes, user testing, style guide and mockups of the final design. I worked on this project from early June to late July of
              2021.

            <h3> User Story & Flows </h3>
            <p> Before I began developing wireframes, I established the various paths that a user may take when trying to accomplish their goals within the app. The user flow diagram was built illustrating how users would navigate throughout the
              application to achieve the tasks outlined in their stories. I then combined the user stories to include all possible routes a user could navigate throughout the application to achieve the tasks outlined in their stories.

            <p> The Low Fidelity Wireframes were used to develop a prototype, which was then tested on five participants. Each of the five participants were given a scenario to test if the given objective could be completed. The feedback collected
              from the results were valuable to showcase pain points and improve the design further.

            <h3> Style Guide </h3>
            <p> The style and language was designed to give the user a sense of calm, with a minimal and sleek design. Blue symbolizes confidence, trust and loyalty. Brown gold symbolizes quality, luxury, and durability. I wanted users to feel at
              ease by using concise and succinct language. As a pet owner myself, I wanted to keep the titles and sentences as short as possible so that users can focus on what matters most, their animals.

            <p> After gathering information from user feedback and making the recommended improvements, my final mockups were created to illustrate the shop, search and purchase processes. 
              As a user you can shop recommendations based on your profile. Create lists to organize favorites or save products for later. View detailed information about products and discover why you'll love them!
              Find the design style you're looking for by browsing through several options to fit your home. Choose your criteria based on animal, price, and design requirements.
              Add your favorite items to the cart to place your order and watch as live updates appear to track your package on its way to your door.

            <h3> Conclusion </h3>
            <p> My goal was to create an app that offers customers pet products that are stylish and functional. Through creating user stories and flows, sketching wireframes, conducting user tests, designing a style guide, and developing multiple
              design iterations I was able to bring my application to life. I created a product that would serve users more effectively by providing a simple experience for pet owners seeking both stylish and functional products for their pets.
