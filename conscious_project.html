          <h2> Overview </h2>
          <p> Conscious is an iOS and Android native application that encourages users to implement change by becoming a more conscious shopper. The application is intended to educate users on how the products and companies they choose, support or
            align with their values.</p>
          <h3> My Role </h3>
          <p>I was the UI/UX Designer for this project. I did everything from the initial concept and visual identity to user flows, wireframes, prototyping and the final screens and mockups.</p>
          <h3> Duration </h3>
          <p>I worked on the project from early April to early June 2021.</p>

            <h2> My Process </h2>
            <h3> Research </h3>
            <p> After reviewing a few different native applications that I found similar to my concept, I discovered features that would be beneficial to include. During this process I also noticed features that I wanted to improve upon based on
              competitor applications.</p>

            <h3> Ideation </h3>
            <p> During the UX Portion of this project I created I user flow diagram based on three user scenarios. The first “I want to browse companies and products that fit my values.” The second “I want to learn more about the companies I
              support and if they align to my values.” The last “I want to scan products I use.” All three of these were necessary to build the he Minimum (or Most) Viable Product (MVP).</p>

            <p> Using the latest human interface guidelines and Material Designs I created two mid fidelity wireframes of the app that use standard UI elements from each Apple and Android mobile operating system.</p>

            <h3> User Testing </h3>
            <p> I tested my mid fidelity wireframes on seven users. Many expressed their need for an app of this type, and praised the visual design. Each provided praise and valuable feedback on some pain points in the app.</p>

            <h3> Final Design & Mockups </h3>
            <p> Through the helpful information I recived from my user testing I finalized my designs. I created eleven screens for each of operating system, iOS and Android. All screens can be broken down into a few main categories depending on
              function and content. The first category is The Onboarding Process. These screens provide users with a short introduction of the app and the option to sign up or sign in. The second category are the Search and Filtering screens which
              take up a large portion of the conscious app as there are multiple screens that allow users to search. The last category are The Company And Product Infomation screens. These are the features that allows users to better understand in
              better detail the values a company or product might have in contrast to their own.</p>

              <h3> Conclusion </h3>
              <p> My main goal was to adhere to the strict human interface and material guidelines to create an app that helps its users become more conscious shoppers. Through research, wireframes, user feedback and multiple design iterations I
                was
                able
                to reach my goal by staying within each operating systems guidelines and watch my app come to life.</p>
