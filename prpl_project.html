            <h2> Overview </h2>
            <p> Prpl is a native iOS app that allows users to listen to their favorite artists or songs. Users can share music with their friends as well as see what other users are listening to. With Prpl, users can listen to music of their choice,
              search the vast collection of songs, and expand their personal libraries. Users can watch live lyrics on a screen to better learn their favorite songs or gain familiarity with new music.
            </p>
            <p>I was the UI/UX designer on this project. I was the UI/UX designer in this project. I developed the initial concept, research, wireframes, style guide and mockups of the final designs. I worked on this project from early July to mid
              September of 2020. Design tools used: Invision, Figma, Photoshop, Flowmapp and Sketch.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p> One of the first steps taken in creating Prpl was understanding the main music applications on the market today. After some research I narrowed down two popular apps, spotify and google music. I identified both competitors and
              analyzed their applications to determine their strengths and weaknesses relative to Prpl. Through timely research, I found features that would be beneficial to include.

          <!-- SECTION: wireframes -->
          <div class="text-content" id="wireframes">
            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p> Low fidelity wireframes were created to ensure necessary application features were included and accessible to all users. One of the major challenges I faced when heading into the creation of the Prpl app was visually competing with
              a popular app like spotify, that has a large audience. The question I had to ask myself over and over again was what makes this app better or unique enough to entice users to try something different. One way I combated this was
              through the wireframing process and the creation of a visual lyric feature. As a music lover myself, and through some feature testing I conducted on users, others shared the belief that seeing lyrics to their favorite songs would
              improve their music listening experience. The second feature I found important to implement when building the app was the social aspect many enjoy when listening to music. A lot of popular apps don’t include their social features on
              the native app themselves only on larger devices. Again, trying to make Prpl stand out I felt it would be important to implement a way users would share with friends and see what others were listening to on the native app. In the
              wireframes this was included on the home screen so users could easily access the feature without having to navigate further. The creation of the wireframes for Prpl was not without its challenges, but was incredibly rewarding.

            <h3> Style Guide </h3>
            <p> The style choices I made followed the trends of other popular music applications. I chose a vibrant bold color to be the focal point of Prpl’s branding. Prpl creates a sense of luxury and reflects creativity while preserving a sense
              of simplicity. The typography and icons I selected were modern and minimalistic to appeal to my target demographic, being young adults and teens.

            <h3> Final Design & Mockups </h3>
            <p> Prpl was developed to improve the users' experience while listening to music. Vibrant displays, and exciting features were created to give the user an enjoyable experience while connecting with friends and their favorite artists.
              The application was created with a mobile first design approach knowing most users would interact mostly on their mobile devices. I felt this type of design approach was best as it allows users optimal viewing experiences on any
              mobile device. Though it took many iterations and improvements, Prpl's final design was completed.

            <h3> Conclusion </h3>
            <p>My goal with this project was to offer users a stylish and functional way to listen, share, and save music. Through creating user stories and flows, sketching wireframes, conducting user tests, designing a style guide, and developing
              multiple design iterations I was able to create a mobile application that I wish I could find today on the market. If given the opportunity for next steps on this project I would love to design for larger devices. This project was
              meant just for mobile as that is primarily where most user traffic comes from, but if given more time and freedom, I would have liked to create layouts for multiple devices and screens. With larger screens it would be exciting to see
              other features that could come to life within the Prpl app. Knowing what I know now after finalizing the Prpl app, I will be able to design future projects with less intimidation. Designing an application with many larger competitors
              in the market at first was something I had to proceed with caution knowing I had a lot of work to do. If I were to start from the very beginning again, I feel I would have more confidence in my ability to develop a new innovative spin
              on an application in an already saturated market. I have found that there is improvement to be found anywhere and I am less intimidated to find what can be built up to be made better.
