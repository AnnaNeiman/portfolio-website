            <h2> Summary </h2>
            <p> For the past four months, I have worked with a cross-functional team to improve a health care company's portal. The first step was to identify and address the frustrations users experienced when interacting with the portal.
            </p>

          <!-- SECTION: Problem to Solve -->
          <div class="text-content" id="Problem-to-solve">
            <h3> Problem to Solve </h3>
            <p> After hearing user pain points, I discovered that loading times between screens were a major issue. Additionally, users were frustrated by seeing a spinning wheel without an indicator of load time. It was difficult for users to
              predict how long it would take for the page to load, which upset them.

            <h3> My Deliverables and Role </h3>
            <p> My Role as the UX/UI Designer was to:
              <li>Idenify and analyze user frustrations with the portal
              </li>
              <li>Determine which users were experiencing the most difficulties in the portal
              </li>
              <li>Improve the loading indicator to address users' frustrations
              </li>
              <li>Implement skeleton loaders throughout and eliminate the old spinning wheel that annoyed users
              </li>
            </p>
          </div>
          <!-- SECTION: Outcome and Solution  -->
          <div class="text-content" id="Outcome-Solution">
            <h3> Outcome and Solution </h3>
            <p> Following investigation and testing, the team implemented skeleton loaders to address the frustrating load times and irritating spinners over the course of two sprints. To begin, I analyzed several types of users and identified their
              journeys. I focused my attention on the two most impacted groups of users, those who encountered the most problems and frequently interacted with the site. The login user journey had the longest loading time, so it was prioritized
              first. After creating the user flows, mockups and prototypes were created for the login journey. Shortly thereafter, skeleton loaders were designed and incorporated into the remaining portal screens. The skeleton loaders were preferred
              by users as they provided the impression of a shorter period of time since they focused their attention on progress rather than waiting.

          <div class="text-content" id="Design-thinking">
            <h3> Design Thinking Process </h3>
            <h5> Empathize:
              <span> I began this process by empathizing with the major frustrations users were experiencing within the Health Care Company's portal. As I attempted to find solutions to these frustrations, our users remained at the
                forefront of my mind.
              </span>
            </h5>
            <h5> Define:
              <span> In order to determine a solution that would effectively solve the issue at hand, I had to identify the main user groups that interacted with the current implementation the most as well as their different journeys. Upon
                understanding the users better, I was able to define the biggest problems and the underlying causes of their frustrations.
              </span>
            </h5>
            <h5> Ideate:
              <span> After investigation, research, and numerous brainstorming sessions, the decision was made to replace spinning loaders with skeleton loaders. It was also necessary to conduct brainstorming sessions in order to determine the
                most appropriate locations for the new loaders to be added. Since the cards on the portal took a long time to load, the focus was on those elements in order to effectively address users' frustrations.
              </span>
            </h5>
            <h5> Prototype:
              <span> To get a sense of how the skeleton loader would appear throughout the website, prototypes and low fidelity mock-ups were created. Consequently, stakeholders and users could interact and provide feedback without worrying
                about getting too far into the implementation process, allowing us to iterate on the design.
              </span>
            </h5>
            <h5> Test:
              <span> A number of meetings were held to discuss the prototypes and iterate on the design choices. There were several conversations and tests conducted in order to determine which components should be converted into skeleton loaders
                and what information could be loaded quickly enough to remain on the page. Initially, all information was presented in gray loaders. It was determined through testing and iteration that some content loaded instantly whereas others
                took a longer time to load. The final design and the last iteration reflected this decision after it had been established that the solution would meet the needs
                of all users.
              </span>
            </h5>
            <h5> Implement:
              <span> In cooperation with a few developers, I ensured we had not missed anything in our process to implement the skeleton loaders and that everyone was on the same page throughout the development process.
              </span>
            </h5>
            <h5> Conclusion:
              <span> My objective in this project was to understand the pain points our users had raised regarding the current load indicator and the time it took to navigate through the site. As I heard these frustrations, I made sure to
                keep them in mind as I met with developers and stakeholders to find solutions. As a result of the creation of user personas and flows, sketching wireframes, conducting tests and going through multiple design iterations, my team and I
                were able to further improve our users' loading experience.
              </span>
