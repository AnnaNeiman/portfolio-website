            <h2> Overview </h2>
            <p> Sensitive Kitchen is a responsive web app for users who are looking for easy-to-follow recipes and meal prep, that cater to individuals with common food sensitivities. Sensitive Kitchen will make finding substitutes for favorite
              recipes easy and inspiring regardless of skill level.
            </p>
            <p>I was the UI/UX designer in this project. I developed the initial concept, user stories and flows, wireframes, user testing, style guide and mockups of the final responsive designs. I worked on this project from January to March of
              2021. Design tools used: Invision, Photoshop, illustrator and Sketch.

            <h3>User Personas & Flows</h3>
            <p> The development of Sensitive Kitchen began with user research. Three individuals were interviewed for this study, some with food sensitivities, and others seeking more inspiration on recipes as well as those who are looking to enhance
              their skills. Based on the feedback collected, three user personas were developed from the combined goals, likes, and behaviors of the interviewees. 
            </p>
            <p> After creating user personas, the information was used to build Individual user flows that were designed to represent how one would navigate throughout the site. In the end, all of the flows were blended into a single, cohesive site
              map that illustrates the possible paths users could take to travel through the application as a whole.

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p> The “Crazy 8” method was used to rapidly sketch eight different solutions to the same problem in the course of eight minutes. Further testing was conducted to determine the functionality and responsiveness of the initial designs.
              After gathering feedback from users and ensuring the application is functional, the wireframes were digitized.

            <h3> Style Guide </h3>
            <p> Colors and typefaces were chosen to ensure a consistent style throughout the app. The application had to not only look good but also function in a manner that differentiated itself from the competition. One way this was accomplished
              was by making multiple icons to tell the user all the important nutritional facts for each recipe in a visually appealing manner. The typeface was selected for its beautiful but easy-to-read design, while the color scheme created a
              relaxing environment that would make it easier for users to discover recipes.

            <p> Sensitive Kitchen was developed to simplify the users' experience while cooking and serve as an aid to their culinary enjoyment, so it was also required to be able to adapt to any user's screen. The application was created with mobile
              devices in mind, so users can get an optimal viewing experience on any mobile device, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer.

            <h3> Conclusion </h3>
            <p> My goal was to offer a responsive web app for users who are looking for easy-to-follow recipes and meal prep, that cater to individuals with common food sensitivities. As a person who has food sensitivities and often struggles with
              finding easy to follow recipes that can cater to my needs, this was a very rewarding product to create. Through my user testings as well it was also very evident that there is a need for something like this in the market and it was
              gratifying to learn how much a responsive web application can make a difference in a user's day to day. With this project, I had the opportunity to use my UI/UX design skills to not only simplify user experience, but also help people.
